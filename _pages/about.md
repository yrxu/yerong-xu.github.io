My name is Yerong Xu (许叶融). I was born in Huangshan (黄山), a small town in China, and grew up in Shanghai (上海). I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in the department of astronomy & physics at Saint Mary's University, Canada, working with Dr. Luigi Gallo.

My research interest focuses on black holes, particularly supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in the center of most galaxies. I am expertise in X-ray spectroscopy and timing techniques to study the circumnuclear environment of SMBHs. The X-ray spectra and time series from the vicinity of accreting black holes carry rich signatures of the accretion and ejection materials near black holes.
